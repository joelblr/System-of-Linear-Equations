## Overview

A system of linear equations is a collection of two or more linear equations involving the same set of variables. The solutions to such systems are the values of the variables that satisfy all equations simultaneously.

This repository provides Python implementations for solving systems of linear equations using multiple numerical methods. The primary focus is on demonstrating how to solve these systems programmatically.

## Methods Implemented

The following methods are implemented to solve systems of linear equations:

- **Gaussian Elimination**
- **Gauss-Jordan Elimination**
- **LU Decomposition**
- **Cramer's Rule**
- **Matrix Inversion Method**

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joelblr/System-of-Linear-Equations.git
cd System-of-Linear-Equations
```
## Requirements

The code in this repository requires Python 3.x and the following libraries:

- `numpy`: For handling matrix operations

You can install the required libraries using `pip`:


## Usage

Each method is implemented in separate Python files. You can run each file individually to see the method in action.

To run the Gaussian Elimination method:
```bash
python run.py
```


Make sure to customize the matrix input in the respective file before running the code.
